The 2019_06 extraction corresponds to version V02 of the product covering the period 1999–2018. It uses the exposure files from the 2017_04, 2018_04, and 2019_04 folders and applies the following corrections:

- Exclusion of foreign credit (October 2006 to December 2008);
- Inclusion of joint credit for remaining debtors.

This is not a new extraction, nor a product built from scratch. It only provides:

- An updated manual;
- Updated CRC_FRMBNK files for 1999–2018;
- Updated CRC_FRM files for 1999–2018.

To obtain EXP and COVER files, please refer to the previous extraction folder as usual. These remain in version V01.
