# General Information

This guide provides instructions on how to use containers in BPLIM's infrastructure. Follow these steps to request a container for your project:

1.  Determine your requirements: Before requesting a container, identify your specific needs for statistical tools, packages, and any other necessary software.

2.  Contact BPLIM's team: After identifying your container requirements, reach out to BPLIM's team by sending an email to `bplim@bportugal.pt` with the details from Step 1.

3.  Await a response: After submitting your request, you will receive a response from BPLIM's team. The team will review your requirements and provide you with a container that meets your specifications.

4.  Configure the container: Once the container is ready, BPLIM's team will configure it for you and provide you with the necessary details to access and utilize the container.

5.  Review the container: Upon receiving the container, carefully review it to ensure that it meets your requirements. Contact BPLIM if you have any questions or concerns that need clarification.


# Access to the container

## Alternative A: use a pre-defined setup

Once you have logged in to the server, you will see an icon that opens the container for your project. To launch the container and start the predefined application that you specified in your request, simply double-click on the icon. Once you have completed this step, it will function similarly to any other application.

## Alternative B: use the command line

This solution makes use of the `Terminal`, giving you more freedom to interact with the container. Follow the steps below:

1.  Open a Terminal in your project's work_area <br>

    (e.g., `/bplimext/projects/PROJECT_ID/work_area`).

2.  The container is located in your project's tools folder <br>

    (`/bplimext/projects/PROJECT_ID/tools/_container`).

3.  Run the container using the following command:

```sh
singularity shell ../tools/iPROJECT_ID.BPLIM_Python_R_Jupyter.sif
```

4.  Inside the container, the prompt will change to `Singularity >`

> ![](images/prompt_singularity.PNG)

5.  For example, to open a Jupyter Notebook, type:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

If you want to use Stata or RStudio, type `xstata-mp` or `rstudio`, respectively.

6.  When you're finished using the container, type exit to leave the Singularity image.


# Build and replicate the container of your project

In this section, we will discuss how to replicate your project's container locally. To do this, you'll need a running instance of Singularity and the script used to build the container for your project (which can be requested from BPLIM). If you have these, just open a `Terminal` on your computer and type:

```sh
singularity build --fake-root iPROJECT_ID.BPLIM_Python_R_Jupyter.sif 
PROJECT_ID.BPLIM_Python_R_Jupyter.def
```


You also have the option to write your own script for your project's container, which we can then build and make available in your `tools` folder.

The steps to build a Singularity container discussed below are designed for Linux, but with minor adjustments, they can also be applied in other environments.

Note that although it is possible to build Singularity containers on Windows, it requires a Linux virtual machine or a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment. Once you have set up a Linux environment, you can use the Singularity command-line tools to build your container.[^1]

## Starting point: the container

A Singularity container is a way to package and distribute software and its dependencies in a portable and isolated environment. To build a Singularity container, you'll need to have Singularity installed on your system.

Here are the basic steps to build a container:

1.  Create a recipe/definition file: This is a text file that contains the instructions for building the container. The recipe file should specify the base image to use, any additional software to install, and any environment variables to set.

2.  Build the container: Use the singularity `build` command to build the container from the recipe file. For example:

```sh
singularity build mycontainer.sif recipe.def
```


3.  Test the container: Use the singularity shell command to enter the container and test that it runs correctly. For example:

`singularity shell mycontainer.sif`

4.  (optional) Publish your container to a public or private registry, like Singularity Hub or Singularity Container Library.

In the [Appendix](#appendix) of this manual, you will find an example of a definition file for building a container with Stata. For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, you can refer to the official documentation at https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/index.html. Additionally, here is a simple recipe file that creates a container based on the Ubuntu 20.04 base image and installs the nano text editor:

```sh
        Bootstrap: library
        From: ubuntu:20.04

        %post
            apt-get update
            apt-get install -y nano
```


## The definition file step by step

In a Singularity definition file, you can write a variety of commands and instructions. Some common things you might include in the file are:

1.  **Package installation**: You can use package managers like `apt` or `yum` to install software and dependencies that your container needs to run. For example, you might install a specific version of Python or a library that your application depends on.

2.  **Environment setup**: You can use commands like `ENV` or export to set environment variables that your container needs to run. For example, you might set the `PATH` variable to include the location of a specific binary or library.

3.  **File copy**: You can use commands like `COPY` or `ADD` to copy files from the host system into the container. For example, you might copy a script or a configuration file that your application needs to run.

4.  **Runscript**: As previously stated, the `Runscript` is a script that is executed when the container is run. It typically contains commands to set up the environment and launch the application or process that the container is designed to run.

5.  **Labels**: You can include information about the container, such as the container's name, version, and author.

6.  **Help**: You can include a brief description of the container, which is useful for users who are trying to understand what the container does.

It's worth noting that depending on the complexity of your container and the requirements of your application, you may need to include additional commands and instructions in your definition file.


### **`header`**

In a Singularity definition file, the "header" refers to the first section of the file that contains metadata and instructions for building the container. The header typically includes information such as the container's name, version, and author, as well as instructions for obtaining and installing the software that the container is designed to run. The header also can include instructions for configuring the build environment, such as setting environment variables or installing dependencies. The header is usually written in a specific format (e.g. #!Singularity) and starts at the first line of the file.

```sh
        #!Singularity
        Bootstrap: library
        From: ubuntu:20.04

        %help
        This container runs Stata.

        %labels
        AUTHOR BPLIM
        VERSION v1.0
```

This header uses the `Bootstrap: library` to indicate that the container should be built using the Singularity Library, and uses the `From: ubuntu:20.04` to indicate that the container is based on the Ubuntu 20.04 image. This header also includes a `%help` section that provides a brief description of the container, and a `%labels` section that includes information about the container's author and version.

It's worth noting that the way headers are written is not fixed and different instructions could be included.


### **`runscript`**

The "runscript" in a Singularity definition file is a script that is executed when the container is run. It typically contains commands to set up the environment and launch the application or process that the container is designed to run. The `runscript` is executed by the Singularity runtime after the container is started, and it can be used to configure the container's environment, set up the application, and launch the application or process.

An example:

```sh
    %runscript
        Rscript myscript.R
```


In case you want the container to execute a Stata .do file you can write something along the following lines:

```sh
    %runscript
        if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
            echo "Please provide the main script"
            exit 1
        fi
        stata-mp -e do "$1"
        if tail -1 "$log" | egrep "^r\([0-9]+\);"
        then
            exit 1
        else
            exit 0
        fi
```

To launch Stata in graphical mode, your run script should look something like this:

```sh
%runscript
    xstata-mp
```

If your container is named container_name.sif, you can launch Stata inside the container using the Terminal by typing the following command:

```sh
./container_name.sif
```

If you want to execute a particular file, you should type the following command in the Terminal:

```sh
./container_name.sif MyDoFile.do
```


### **`files`**

The `%files` section in a Singularity definition file is used to specify files or directories that should be included in the container image when it is built. Here is an example of what you might include in the `%files` section:

```sh
    %files
    /path/to/myfile1.txt
    /path/to/mydir1
    /path/to/myfile2.sh
    /path/to/mydir2
```



This would include the files `myfile1.txt` and `myfile2.sh` and the directories `mydir1` and `mydir2` in the container image, with the same paths.

You can also use wildcard to copy multiple files or directories, for example :

```sh
    %files
    /path/to/mydir/*
```


This would include all files and directories in the folder `mydir` in the container image.

It's worth noting that the `%files` section is optional, you don't need to include it in your definition file if you don't need to add any additional files to your container. Also, the `%files` section is only useful when creating a new container, if you want to add files to an existing container you can use the singularity copy command.


### **`environment`**

The `%environment` section in a Singularity definition file is used to specify environment variables that should be set when the container is run. Here is an example of what you might include in the `%environment` section to build a container running R version 4.1.1:

```sh
    %environment
        export R_VERSION=4.1.1
        export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R/$R_VERSION
        export PATH=$PATH:$R_HOME/bin
```


This will set the environment variable `R_VERSION` to `4.1.1`, the environment variable `R_HOME` to `/usr/lib/R/4.1.1` and the environment variable `PATH` to include the R's binary path `\$R_HOME/bin`

You can use these environment variables in your `%post` or `%runscript` sections to install R 4.1.1 and run commands with the R version 4.1.1.

This will set the environment variable `R_VERSION` to 4.1.1, the environment variable R_HOME to `/usr/lib/R/4.1.1` and the environment variable PATH to include the R's binary path `\$R_HOME/bin`


```sh
    %post
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base=$R_VERSION
```

It's worth noting that you can also use `ENV` instruction in place of export and you can use `%environment` section to set any environment variable you want, not only R.


### **`post`**

The `%post` section in a Singularity definition file is used to specify commands that should be run during the container build process, after the base image has been imported. Here is an example of what you might include in the `%post` section to build a container running R version 4.1.1 and the most recent version of RStudio Server:

```sh
    %post
        # update package lists and install R 4.1.1
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base=$R_VERSION
        
        # add RStudio repository and key
        echo "deb https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu <br>
        bionic-cran35/" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
        apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <br>
        E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
        
        # install RStudio Server
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y rstudio-server
```


This will update the package lists, install R version 4.1.1 using the environment variable set before and add the RStudio repository and key to the container, then install RStudio Server on the container.

It's worth noting that this example assumes that the container is based on Ubuntu 20.04 (codenamed 'focal'), if you are using a different version or distribution you should adjust the package manager commands and repository URLs accordingly.

Also, the `%post` section is optional and you don't need to include it in your definition file if you don't need to run any additional command during the container building process.

If you also want to include Jupyter Notebook, the R kernel and R *nbextensions* in your container, you can add the following commands to the `%post` section of your Singularity definition file:

```sh
    %post
        # update package lists and install R 4.1.1
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base=$R_VERSION
        
        # add RStudio repository and key
        echo "deb https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu 
        bionic-cran35/" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
        apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys
        E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
        
        # install RStudio Server
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y rstudio-server
        
        # install Jupyter
        apt-get install -y jupyter-core
        
        # install R kernel for Jupyter
        R -e "install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 
        'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest'), 
        repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
        R -e "devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')"
        R -e "IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)"
        
        
        # install R nbextensions
        R -e "install.packages('devtools', repos = 
        'https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
        R -e "devtools::install_github('randy3k/r-notebook')"
        
```


This will install Jupyter, the R kernel for Jupyter, and the R `nbextensions` for Jupyter Notebook.

It's worth noting that these commands are installing R packages from CRAN and GitHub repositories, so you may want to check that these repositories are available on your system and that you have internet connection during the container build process.

Note: you can install packages from binaries.


### Including additional packages

To include TinyTeX and machine learning packages in your container, you can add the following commands to the `%post` section of your Singularity definition file:

```sh
    %post
        # update package lists and install R 4.1.1
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y r-base=$R_VERSION
        
        # add RStudio repository and key
        echo "deb https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu
        bionic-cran35/" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
        apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys
        E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
        
        
        # install RStudio Server
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y rstudio-server
        
        
        # install Jupyter
        apt-get install -y jupyter-core
        
        
        # install R kernel for Jupyter
        R -e "install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate',
        'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest'),
        repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
        R -e "devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')"
        R -e "IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)"
        
        
        # install R nbextensions
        R -e "install.packages('devtools', repos = 
        'https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
        R -e "devtools::install_github('randy3k/r-notebook')"
        
        
        # install TinyTeX
        wget -qO- "https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/raw/main/tools/inst
        all-unx.sh" | sh
        
        
        # install additional R packages
        R -e "install.packages(c('caret','randomForest','e1071','gbm','
        xgboost', 'lightgbm','catboost','mlr','tidymodels','h2o','caret
        Ensemble','pROC','ROCR',  
        'pROC.plot','ROCR.plot','kernlab','pls','neuralnet','nnet'), 
        repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
        
        
```


This will install TinyTeX, which is a lightweight, cross-platform, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution and also some popular machine learning packages such as caret, `randomForest`, `e1071`, `gbm`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`, `mlr`, `tidymodels`, `h2o`, `caretEnsemble`, `pROC`, `ROCR`, `pROC.plot`, `ROCR.plot`, `kernlab`, `pls`, `neuralnet`, and `nnet`.


### Cleaning temporary files

To clean up temporary files during the build process of your container, you can add the following command to the `%post` section of your Singularity definition file:

```sh
    %post
        # ... other commands ...
        # clean up temporary files
        apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
```


This command will remove all temporary files created during the installation of packages, including package lists and downloaded package files. By doing this, it will help to keep your container's size as small as possible, and can also help to avoid potential issues with the container.

You can also include this set of commands at the end of your `%runscript`, so that when the container runs it will clean temporary files after the completion of the container's job.

```sh
    %runscript
       # commands to run your container
       ...
       apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
```

This will keep your container clean and ready for the next run.

In the example provided in the [Appendix](#appendix) we also added:

```sh
        apt-get update
        apt-get autoremove
        apt-get autoclean
```

## Building the container

```sh
time singularity build --fakeroot iPROJECT_ID_BPLIM.sif PROJECT_ID_BPLIM.def
```


We usually name the image with the prefix `i` followed by the name of the definition file. For example, `iBPLIM-Stata_V1.sif`, where the definition file is named `BPLIM-Stata_V1.def`.
